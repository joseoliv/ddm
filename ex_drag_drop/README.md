# ex_drag_drop

A new Flutter project.

## How this project was created


Change #file:main.dart  so that in the screen there appears two containers with shadows. The left is green (very light) and the right is orange (very light). Both with shadows. They divide the screen in two parts with generous spaces to the left, between the containers, and to the right. And some space above and below these containers. 

The left container should have a button "Move me", an Icon (choose one funny), a 100x50 blue container, a triangle of sizes 70 points each side, a square of size 80x80 of color red. Choose something small (button size) to further add to the left container. Make every one of these widgets draggable. Allow them to be dragged to the right container and vice-versa.
